    "    The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize and structure code in a way that reflects the real-world entities and their interactions. In Python and other programming languages that support OOP, the central concept is the \"object.\" An object is an instance of a class, and a class defines a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
    "    The main goals of OOP in Python (and in general) include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  (1) Modularity: OOP promotes the division of complex software systems into smaller, self-contained modules (classes). This enhances code reusability and maintainability by allowing changes to be made in one part of the code without affecting other parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (2) Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (object). It helps to hide the internal implementation details of an object, allowing changes to be made to the internal structure without affecting the overall functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (3) Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of real-world entities. This allows programmers to focus on the relevant aspects of an object while ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (4) Inheritance: Inheritance is the process by which a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of more specialized classes that build upon the features of a more general class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (5) Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class through a unified interface. This enables more flexible and generic coding since different classes can implement their own versions of methods, which are calle\n",

    "    In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a real-world entity, data structure, or value. Everything in Python is an object, and objects are instances of classes, which are the blueprints or templates for creating objects. Objects have attributes (data) and methods (functions) associated with them.\n",
    "    Here are some key points to understand about objects in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   (1) Instances of Classes: Objects are instances of classes. A class defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their attributes (variables) and methods (functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "  (2) Attributes: Attributes are variables that hold data associated with an object. They can store various types of information, such as numbers, strings, lists, or other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (3) Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the attributes of an object. They allow you to perform actions or computations related to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (4) Object Identity: Each object in Python has a unique identity, which can be obtained using the id() function. This identity is guaranteed to be unique during the lifetime of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (5) Object Type: Objects have a type that determines the class from which they were created. You can check an object's type using the type() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (6) Object Creation: Objects are created by calling the constructor of a class. The constructor is a special method named __init__() that initializes the object's attributes when it's created.\n",
